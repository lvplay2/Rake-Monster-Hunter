# Rake Monster Hunter
A decompilation of Rake Monster Hunter, made with [AssetRipper](https://github.com/AssetRipper/AssetRipper).

Editor version: 2017 (I had to migrate the project to the latest 2017 version to avoid compiler errors).

This unofficial build aims in adding new features and fixing bugs that OneTonGames was never able to fix.
If you find a bug, please report it in the GitHub repository.

This build is FREE. If you paid a third party service for this, YOU HAVE BEEN SCAMMED!

# WARNING
Ignore warnings and errors, they do not affect the game at all.
