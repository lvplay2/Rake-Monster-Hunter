# Rake Monster Hunter
A decompilation of Rake Monster Hunter, made with [AssetRipper](https://github.com/AssetRipper/AssetRipper).

Editor version: 2017 (I had to migrate the project to the latest 2017 version to avoid compiler errors).

# WARNING
Ignore warnings and errors, they do not affect the game at all.
